The C implementation for Latent Dirichlet Allocation with collapsed gibbs sampling estimation.
These codes are based on Daichi Mochihashi's C implementation (http://chasen.org/~daiti-m/dist/lda/) but using collapsed gibbs sampling methods instead of variational baysian methods. (using formulas from http://psiexp.ss.uci.edu/research/papers/sciencetopics.pdf)
